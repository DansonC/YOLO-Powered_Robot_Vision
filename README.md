# YOLO-Powered_Robot_Vision

***

* [Written by Korean version]()

## Introduction

This is a Pi-based robot to implement visual recognition([by YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/yolo_1.pdf)). The YOLO-Powered vision can recognize many objects such as people, car, bus, fruits, and so on. 

* Hardware: Raspberry-Pi2, Sony PS3 Eye Camera
 
   (Available to use Logitech C270 USB camera with Raspberry Pi)

* Software: YOLO(v2), Jupyter-Notebook

## My motivation
I'm so interested in performance of the image recognition with TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi. In addition, the Jupyter notebook is really convenient to instantly code as a quick prototype. The Raspberry pi's processing speed is very slow compare to my laptop.
